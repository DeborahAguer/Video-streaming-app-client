# Video Streaming app Client Side
This is the client side app for the video streaming app

## Technology Stacks:
Nextjs 14
React
Typescript
Chakra UI
Axios
Context api


1. ## Next.js 14:
   Next.js 14 has been utilized as the foundation for building the project's frontend. Leveraging its features for server-side rendering and static site generation, I have created a fast and SEO-friendly web application.

2. ## React:
   React forms the core of the project's frontend, enabling the creation of reusable UI components and managing the application's state efficiently. By utilizing React, I have developed dynamic and interactive user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

3. ## TypeScript:
   TypeScript has been employed to improve code maintainability and scalability. By adding static types to JavaScript, I have ensured type safety and caught errors during development, resulting in higher code quality and improved developer productivity.

4. ## Chakra UI:
   Chakra UI components have been integrated into the project to establish a consistent and visually appealing design system. Leveraging the customizable and accessible UI components provided by Chakra UI, I have streamlined the development of the project's frontend.

5. ## Axios:
   Axios has been used for making asynchronous HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend. By utilizing Axios, I have simplified the process of fetching data from external APIs or communicating with the server, enhancing the project's data retrieval and management capabilities.

6. ## Context API:
   The Context API has been employed for managing global state in the application. By utilizing the Context API, I have centralized the management of shared state and provided data to components throughout the project, reducing the need for prop drilling and improving code organization.

These technologies have collectively contributed to the development of a modern and efficient web application, enabling features such as server-side rendering, dynamic user interfaces, and global state management.

## Getting Started

Rename .env.example to .env.local

Install dependencies:
Run ```npm install``

run the development server:

Run and start the api first

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
